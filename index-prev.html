		<h2>What happens in a music therapy session?</h2>
		
		<h3>Individual sessions</h3>
		<p>One-on-one music therapy sessions are provided at least once per week for 45 or 60 minutes. Through an assessment process, a child’s strengths and areas of need are identified. The music therapist develops personalized experiences for each client, using music to motivate and engage them. These experiences are used to work on the child’s non-musical goals. Based on each child’s needs and preferences, musical experiences may include singing, dancing, playing a wide variety of instruments, songwriting, improvisation, and more! Multi-sensory musical experiences may also incorporate the use of scarves, beanbags, bubbles, puppets, and other props. Music therapists can collaborate with teachers and other therapists to further build skills. This includes classroom teachers, OTs, SLPs, PTs, ABA therapists, etc.</p>
		
		<h3>Group Sessions</h3>
		<p>Grow Music groups are available to families, schools, and community organizations. These groups help support children’s development through collaborative musical experiences. Many groups focus on the development of social skills such as sharing, taking turns, teamwork, group problem solving, etc. Sibling sessions are also available, with an emphasis placed on positive and successful sibling interactions. Specialized groups can be developed. Contact Tina for more information.</p>
