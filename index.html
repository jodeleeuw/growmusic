          <h2>What is music therapy?</h2>

          <p class="intro">
            Music therapy uses music as a tool to build skills and
            understanding. Board certified music therapists develop musical
            experiences to assist with areas of need in a developmentally
            appropriate and enjoyable way. Music therapy can also help to
            support typical development and build on children’s strengths in
            conjunction with the efforts of parents, teachers, and other allied
            healthcare providers.

            Music therapy services must be provided by a board certified music
            therapist (MT-BC). This includes the completion of a bachelor’s
            degree or higher in music therapy from a program approved by the
            American Music Therapy Association. In addition to coursework, a
            music therapy student must complete 1200 hours of clinical training,
            including a supervised internship. After completing these
            requirements, the student is eligible to sit for the national board
            certification exam to obtain the MT-BC credential. Music therapists
            must also fulfill continuing education requirements in order to
            maintain board certification status.

        <h2>What happens in a music therapy session?</h2>

        <h3>Individual sessions</h3>
        <p>
          One-on-one music therapy sessions are provided at least once per week
          for 45 or 60 minutes. Through an assessment process, a child’s
          strengths and areas of need are identified. The music therapist
          develops personalized experiences for each client, using music to
          motivate and engage them. These experiences are used to work on the
          child’s non-musical goals. Based on each child’s needs and
          preferences, musical experiences may include singing, dancing, playing
          a wide variety of instruments, songwriting, improvisation, and more!
          Multi-sensory musical experiences may also incorporate the use of
          scarves, beanbags, bubbles, puppets, and other props. Music therapists
          can collaborate with teachers and other therapists to further build
          skills. This includes classroom teachers, OTs, SLPs, PTs, ABA
          therapists, etc.
        </p>

        <h3>Group Sessions</h3>
        <p>
          Grow Music groups are available to families, schools, and community
          organizations. These groups help support children’s development
          through collaborative musical experiences. Many groups focus on the
          development of social skills such as sharing, taking turns, teamwork,
          group problem solving, etc. Sibling sessions are also available, with
          an emphasis placed on positive and successful sibling interactions.
          Specialized groups can be developed. Contact Tina for more
          information.

        <h2>Consultations and Professional Development</h2>

        <h3>Consultations</h3>
        <p>
          Tina is available to consult with families, teachers, schools, and
          other professionals in order to develop individualized musical
          supports for a given situation, theme, person, or classroom. This
          service can include the creation of original songs and materials, such
          as audio recordings, visual aides, instructions for implementation,
          etc.
        </p>

        <h3>Inservices and Workshops</h3>
        <p>
          Tina is also available to share her expertise through speaking
          engagements, such as inservices or workshops. These can be about the
          professional as a whole or about music therapist’s work within certain
          settings or with certain populations. All speaking engagements will
          include demonstrations of relevant musical experiences that a music
          therapist could use to address a client’s goals.

                As guardian of my sister, I honestly feel music therapy with
                Tina these past years has had a significant impact on her
                quality of life. She is able to express her true feelings now
                with confidence. Tina has always been there to support &
                encourage her through many difficult times...and me too. My
                sister has described herself as happy now. I had never heard
                that from her before. She has many friends and has even become a
                cheerleader for them when they have ups & downs! My sister has
                worked very hard and come so far, thanks in great part to Tina's
                skills, professionalism, caring attitude, and compassion. We
                both are thankful to have had you in our lives. I am certain you
                will have a tremendous impact on all those special future
                clients and families. <b class="attr">—J., sister/guardian</b>

                We were blessed to have Tina in our lives for a couple of years!
                My son has Autism, developmental delays, and Anxiety. He was
                having a horrible time in his life when we were able to secure
                her for music therapy! And she made a HUGE difference in his
                life. He began to talk a lot more, express his feelings, and
                just became my happy little boy again! I will be forever
                grateful to her for the time and effort she put into learning
                what makes my son tick. She learned his weaknesses and his
                strength and drew him out by using those. We miss her terribly,
                but know she will be a huge blessing to someone else there in
                New York. May God bless you all. <b class="attr">—S., parent</b>

                Tina is a gift to those around her. My daughter has Down
                syndrome, but she included siblings and even the family pet as
                appropriate --therapy for all of us! Not only is she a talented
                musician who makes music and its benefits accessible to children
                of different abilities, but she is also a kind-hearted person
                who genuinely cares about her clients and their families. She
                tailors the songs and activities (both in preparation/planning
                and during sessions "in the moment") to whatever is best for the
                child. She even went above and beyond and provided a recording
                of one of her "calming" songs while my daughter was experiencing
                severe anxiety during a hospital stay. Music works like a charm
                with my daughter, and she was visibly calmed by hearing Tina's
                voice. I am deeply grateful for what Tina has done for my
                daughter and my family. <b class="attr">—C., parent</b>

                My son was able to make amazing strides through music therapy
                with Tina. She has incredible intuition in working with people
                with disabilities and matches her style to where they are in
                each session. My son has Autism, and what works for him can
                change even within a session. Tina is quick to pick up on it
                making each session productive and fun!

                Music therapy has proved to be beneficial to many different
                people working through different problems and in different areas
                of life. As a service, it is time spent 1:1 with a goal-specific
                outcome. Some of the goals are learning stress reduction
                techniques, while others are more simply maintaining eye contact
                during a session. With the option to make the goals
                individualized, it is beneficial to many different people in
                many different areas of life.
              </p>

              <p>
                Music therapy goals can also be utilized in other services.
                These situations help the clients learn to apply the goals to
                different areas in life. An example would be with music used for
                counting, and then counting to ten used as a stress reduction
                technique, or in identifying time to think before speaking.
              </p>

              <p>
                I would always encourage music therapy as a way to help people
                process through different concerns that occur in life
                situations. <b class="attr">—T., behavior consultant</b>
